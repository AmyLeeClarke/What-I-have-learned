    <h1 style="background-color:#dad7cd">What I have learned today</h1>

    <div id="one">
        <h3>12/04/2023</h3>
        <p>I have learned how to use Beautiful Soup and why it is important. It is able to be used to find specific
            items in any website so that the data can be analysed.</p>
    </div>




    <div id="two">
        <h3>17/04/2023</h3>
        <p>I have learned what MySQL and SQL is and what it does, downloaded everything I need to start this new course.
        I have learned the basics of how to create databases and tables, how to access the data inside these tables and
            DROP/ delete them. Also how to <br>comment out code and write comments.</p></br>
    </div>



    <div id="three">
        <h3>18/04/2023</h3>
        <p>Today I have gained the knowledge to use auto increments, not null and all the basics needed to create a database. I completed an insert exercise where I created a database for employees, this is where their name, age and employment status is kept, along with a primary key. </p>

    <div id="four">
        <h3>19/04/2023</h3>
        <p>Today I have focused on practicing MySQL skills, creating, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) data to get used to using the command line and workbench together. I found this fun and easy to do so far. I am currently working with data on books and authors. I have also <br>learned how to use the CONCAT() function.</br></p>
