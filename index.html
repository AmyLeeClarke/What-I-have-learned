            <p><strong>This page is designed as a diary for my progress in learning code and to hold myself accountable to do and
            continue learning. It is a place where I, and others, are able to come and check on my progress to see what material I have covered and which I am yet to learn.
            The code will mostly consist of Python and SQL.</strong></p>

        <h3>12/04/2023 (Python)</h3>
        <p>I have learned how to use Beautiful Soup and why it is important. It is able to be used to find specific
            items in any website so that the data can be analysed.</p>

        <h3>17/04/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>I have learned what MySQL and SQL is and what it does, downloaded everything I need to start this new course.
        I have learned the basics of how to create databases and tables, how to access the data inside these tables and
            DROP/ delete them. Also how to <br>comment out code and write comments.</p></br>

        <h3>18/04/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>Today I have gained the knowledge to use auto increments, not null and all the basics needed to create a database. I completed an insert exercise where I created a database for employees, this is where their name, age and employment status is kept, along with a primary key. </p>

        <h3>19/04/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>Today I have focused on practicing MySQL skills, creating, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) data to get used to using the command line and workbench together. I found this fun and easy to do so far. I am currently working with data on books and authors. I have also <br>learned how to use the CONCAT() function.</br></p>

        <h3>20/04/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>I have learned how to use the CONCAT and the SUBSTR functions both separately and combine to output initials of listed authors.</p>

        <h3>21/04/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>Today I have learned a lot of different string functions and put them into practice using the book_shop example I started with. These string functions include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Upper and lower case</li>

        <h3>24/04/2022 and 25/04/2023 (Python)</h3>
        <p>Today and yesterday I have struggled with using Selenium with Pycharm. I know that some lessons from the
            course I'm taking are out of date. I spent all of yesterday researching and trying to find the best way to
            use selenium, this included, how to make the browser stay open for more than one split second. I found two
            ways of doing this, one was to import the time module to make it close in 1000 seconds, or the webdriver
            options; which I prefer as it's more stable. I have finally got the base code down with a lot of practice
            and researching. I have made a short program that allows me to Google anything I type automatically through
            selenium.</p>

    <h3>26/04/2023 (Python)</h3>
    <p>Today I have learned how more about how to navigate selenium. I have created a projects which holds all of my
        reviews from my Vinted account over the past two years. With this data, I am going to sort them into categories
        such as 'sent on time' to see my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to people purchasing from my store.</p>

        <h3>27/04/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>I have learned how to use distinct and order by, limit and like functions by using the bookshop database.
            I am finding learning SQL easier than Python at the moment as I get much more completed. I have learned how
            to integrate all of these new functions to get the specific data asked for I have also had practice with
            searching for a lie function which has either a % or an _ which would usually produce an error..</p>

        <h3>28/04/2023 (Python)</h3>
        <p>Today I hve learned how to create a web server using flask and understand some basic code to run on the
            command line which will help me in the future, such as pip installing packages. I have also learned and put
            into practice nesting, passing functions and Python decorators which I found relatively simple and will be
            a nice addition to my Python knowledge.</p>

    <div id="eleven">
        <h3>02/05/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>I have learned some more functions today which consist of min and max, sub queries, group by and how to use
            them interchangeably. I found the sub queries the most difficult as it has to have two different selects which
            run separate but with some practice using the bookshop database, I am able to use it comfortably.</p>
