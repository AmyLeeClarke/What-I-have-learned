    <div id="one">
        <h3>12/04/2023 (Python)</h3>
        <p>I have learned how to use Beautiful Soup and why it is important. It is able to be used to find specific
            items in any website so that the data can be analysed.</p>
        <hr>
    </div>




    <div id="two">
        <h3>17/04/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>I have learned what MySQL and SQL is and what it does, downloaded everything I need to start this new course.
        I have learned the basics of how to create databases and tables, how to access the data inside these tables and
            DROP/ delete them. Also how to <br>comment out code and write comments.</p></br>
        <hr>
    </div>



    <div id="three">
        <h3>18/04/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>Today I have gained the knowledge to use auto increments, not null and all the basics needed to create a database. I completed an insert exercise where I created a database for employees, this is where their name, age and employment status is kept, along with a primary key. </p>

    <div id="four">
        <h3>19/04/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>Today I have focused on practicing MySQL skills, creating, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) data to get used to using the command line and workbench together. I found this fun and easy to do so far. I am currently working with data on books and authors. I have also <br>learned how to use the CONCAT() function.</br></p>

    <div id="five">
        <h3>20/04/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>I have learned how to use the CONCAT and the SUBSTR functions both separately and combine to output initials of listed authors.</p>

        <h3>21/04/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>Today I have learned a lot of different string functions and put them into practice using the book_shop example I started with. These string functions include:</p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>Upper and lower case</li>
                <li>Replace</li>
                <li>Reverse</li>
                <li>Insert</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="list2">
            <ul>
                <li>Left and Right</li>
                <li>Repeat</li>
                <li>Trim, Trailing and both</li>

        <h3>24/04/2022 and 25/04/2023 (Python)</h3>
        <p>Today and yesterday I have struggled with using Selenium with Pycharm. I know that some lessons from the
            course I'm taking are out of date. I spent all of yesterday researching and trying to find the best way to
            use selenium, this included, how to make the browser stay open for more than one split second. I found two
            ways of doing this, one was to import the time module to make it close in 1000 seconds, or the webdriver
            options; which I prefer as it's more stable. I have finally got the base code down with a lot of practice
            and researching. I have made a short program that allows me to Google anything I type automatically through
            selenium.</p>
