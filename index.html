        <h3>19/05/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>Today I have focused on relationships between tables using MySQL workbench and command line. I have created
            two separate tables with specific id's to specific people and orders which I used the JOIN function to create
            a relationship between the two tables. I also used my new knowledge about cross and inner joins to interlink
            these together. This is to allow for data analysis to be conducted using both sets of information. I have also
            learned how to use the foreign key which only allows the input of 'real' id names and if any new orders were
            places that wasn't assigned to a persons id then there would be an error and this data wouldn't be inserted. </p>

        <h3>18/05/2023 (Python)</h3>
        <p>For the first half of the day I have focused on creating graphs and displaying data to answer the business
            questions such as 'what products are mostly sold together?' For this I didn't create a graph I just displayed
            the data and the numbers next to it as I thought this would be the best to display this type of data as we
            were only after the product name and the numbers. To do this I had to write some code which displayed all
            the duplicated items purchased together. This needed intertools and collections to be able to function so I
            imported those, this was so that the program could count and gather the information from specific rows.
            The ony problem with this is that it was showing multiple times in
            the list. To solve this, thanks to stack overflow, I found a way to drop all the unnecessary duplicated items
            which left me with clean data to view. I used the key function and set this to false so that all the duplicated
            orders would be shown.
            <p>The second data I wanted to show was how many of each product was sold in a bar chart. I used the knowledge
            about matplotlib from the other graphs to help display and change how the graph looked and displayed. The final
            graph I created was an overlay graph of a plot and bar chart. This allows for easy comparison between two rows.
            The two rows I compared was the quantity of each product ordered and the price, this showed that the more
            expensive a product was, the less it was purchased which was true in most of the cases according to the graph.</p>
            <p>I did keep getting the same error of future warning however, I haven't yet discovered how to get rid of it,
            all the code runs perfectly fine.</p>

        <p> The second half of my day consisted of creating a new Jupyter Notebook and scraping to find the title of each
            hashtags on a website with the best hashtags to use for Depop selling using BeautifulSoup and Requests.
            Monday I will be creating tables and analysing the data in more advanced details.</p>

        <h3>15/05/2023-16/05/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>Today and yesterday I focused on altering table and all the documentation which comes with it. I managed
            to put this to the test creating and changing some random tables to practice. I have also learned check and
            named constraints which will be very useful in the future if anything in a database needs to be updated and
            or changed.</p>

        <h3>12/05/2023 (Python)</h3>
        <p>Today I have been focusing on analysing the given sales data which I have been doing the past week. I answered
            the question 'What time should we display advertisements to maximise likelihood of customers buying product?'
            To start answering this question I needed a new column which displayed the time of each order in just the hours
            and minutes. To do this I used my skills from Python (before I started this diary) of DateTime to help separate
            the times from the date. The results show the peak times for sales is both 11am and 7pm so the most efficient
            time to advertise would be just before these times as it is the most likely to be seen by a lot more people.
            The reason these times are peak might be because they are just as people are on lunch break or have just come
            home from work. For this graph I used matplotlib again but instead of creating a bar chart I used a plot graph
            to help get me used to the different ranged of charts.</p>

        <h3>11/05/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>For the first half of my day I have learned all about the data and time functions and put these new skills
            to test by creating a table with a couple of people with their name and date of birth and time of birth.
            This allowed me to pick specific data from this table to practice these new functions. I have also learned
            about decimal, float and double along with the difference between int, tinyint bigint, char, varchar,
            curdate and time stamp. Most of these are to do with the amount of data they store. I have also focused
            on update which allows me to find out, automatically, when a line in the table has been created and updated
            which automatically updates the date and time. Date and time formatting was the best part I learned as there
            are so many customizable options to work with using the documentation.</p>
        <img class="date" src="date.PNG"><img class="%%" src="%%.PNG">

        <p>The second half of my day I focused on learning comparison and logical operators. The main ones focused on was
            <, >, !=, >=, <=, OR, AND, CASE, IS NULL, IN, BETWEEN. All of these have been put to the test using the people
            and the bookshop database, so I could use the information to practice. These will be helpful in analysing future
            databases as it allows for me to do specific comparisons easily and neatly.</p>

        <h3>10/05/2023 (Python)</h3>
        <p>I have continued the work I have done from Python Pandas today by answering another question. The question
            is 'What city had the most total sales in 2019?' I answered this by creating another column names Cities and
            repeated the similar analysis I did last time for the months. I did run into a few issues which included all
            the names being cluttered together at the bottom of the bar chart. This was fixed by stack overflow which
            I learned I can style the x-axis to be vertical and the text size can be changed.</p>
        <p>I created two functions which would be both city and state. I decided to create a different state one as there
            was a couple of different cities which are named the same, this would make the analysis a lot more accurate.
            To separate the city from the zip code nd all the other information, I used split which would be split at
            the ',' and the state at the space. I had managed to use the f string which I have learned about in the past
            to make the line of code alot shorter.</p>

        <h3>08/05/2023 (Python Pandas)</h3>
        <p>Today I have really tested my Pandas and Python knowledge within a large data set of online sales for a company.
        This includes items sold, price and id along with what month they were sold. I have followed a tutorial
        online which helped me through this process. I first concatenated all the month files into one large csv file
        so that I could analyse the data set as a whole. I then created a month column which would display the month,
        as a number, which will allow me to see them as a group later on. I then ran into a couple of problems which
        were solved by the use of static overflow. The problems were that some columns has a NaN (Not a Number)
        as a whole column which I was able to group together to remove. This wasn't allowing me to multiply the amount
        sold with the price at it was classed as a sting. I added another column called sales, after I dropped the NaN
            which was just the quantity purchased and the price. </p>

        <p>I then grouped the data (groupby) into months and made the
        data into a viewable bar chart using Matplotlib. This was my first time using this and I found it very easy and
        I love that you are able to visualise data this was which would make it much more simple when explaining results
        to someone else. The screenshots shown are from the video I was following as Jupyter was very bugged out as I
        tried to save, this should be fixed by tomorrow. I will only show a few screenshots as the whole code will be
        available on my GitHub page.</p>

        <h3>04/05/2023 and 05/05/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>Yesterday I focused on trying to analyse my vinted reviews using CSV and Pandas on Pycharm however, I was
            finding limited resources online on how to fix the errors in my code. I am still working on getting this
            fixed. In the meantime, today, I have imported the review data into MySQL and created a new table and
            database. From this I have been able to put to the test all of my new SQL skills I have been learning. I have
            managed to analyse and group how many reviews I get to see where my strengths are when posting items
            using this app. In previous days I had used web scraping to gather the data from Vinted which I used and
            formatted it to be able to be inserted into the SQl table. I have found how many automated reviews I have
            got and how many people have complimented the fast shipping. The images show which other groups I decided
            to do.</p>
        <img class="buyer" src="buyer.PNG"><p>40/212 reviews are me as the buyer so these do not matter.</p><img class="great" src="great.PNG"><p>55/212 said the word 'great' which indicates that they are happy with their purchase and with me as a seller as a whole.</p>
        <img class="postage" src="postage.PNG"><img class="quick" src="quick.PNG"><p>27/212 total specifically mentioned the postage, along with the speed in which the items were sent out.</p>
        <img class="love" src="love.PNG"><p>51/212 mentioned 'love' as either 'lovely seller' or 'love the item' which is one of my strongest attributes.</p>
        <img class="auto" src="auto.PNG"><p>40/212 reviews are automated which means I get a 5 star positive review if they don't leave one, meaning that this group is not the data I am looking for when it comes to finding out my strong points.</p>

        <p>Today I have focused on learning the basics of running a website server using flask, following on from the
            28th. The course I was watching was outdated, so I went over to YouTube which helped me get started. With
            this I learned how to create views and routes along with rendering HTML, URL parameters and query parameters.
            I have found using flask difficult because of the outdated courses however, I will be focusing on this on the
            days I learn Python whilst continuing to work on SQL to refine my skills and put them to test.</p>

        <p>Today and yesterday I have struggled with using Selenium with Pycharm. I know that some lessons from the

            use selenium, this included, how to make the browser stay open for more than one split second. I found two
            ways of doing this, one was to import the time module to make it close in 1000 seconds, or the webdriver
            options; which I prefer as it's more stable. I have finally got the base code down with a lot of practice
            and researching. I have made a short program that allows me to Google anything I type automatically through
            selenium.</p>
