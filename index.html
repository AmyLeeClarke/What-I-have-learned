            <p><strong>This page is designed as a diary for my progress in learning code and to hold myself accountable to do and
            continue learning. It is a place where I, and others, are able to come and check on my progress to see what material I have covered and which I am yet to learn.
            The code will mostly consist of Python and SQL.</strong></p>

        <p>I have learned what MySQL and SQL is and what it does, downloaded everything I need to start this new course.
        I have learned the basics of how to create databases and tables, how to access the data inside these tables and
            DROP/ delete them. Also how to <br>comment out code and write comments.</p></br>

        <p>Today I have gained the knowledge to use auto increments, not null and all the basics needed to create a database. I completed an insert exercise where I created a database for employees, this is where their name, age and employment status is kept, along with a primary key. </p>

        <p>Today I have focused on practicing MySQL skills, creating, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) data to get used to using the command line and workbench together. I found this fun and easy to do so far. I am currently working with data on books and authors. I have also <br>learned how to use the CONCAT() function.</br></p>

        <h3>24/04/2022 and 25/04/2023 (Python)</h3>
        <p>Today and yesterday I have struggled with using Selenium with Pycharm. I know that some lessons from the
            course I'm taking are out of date. I spent all of yesterday researching and trying to find the best way to
            use selenium, this included, how to make the browser stay open for more than one split second. I found two
            ways of doing this, one was to import the time module to make it close in 1000 seconds, or the webdriver
            options; which I prefer as it's more stable. I have finally got the base code down with a lot of practice
            and researching. I have made a short program that allows me to Google anything I type automatically through
            selenium.</p>

    <h3>26/04/2023 (Python)</h3>
    <p>Today I have learned how more about how to navigate selenium. I have created a projects which holds all of my
        reviews from my Vinted account over the past two years. With this data, I am going to sort them into categories
        such as 'sent on time' to see my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to people purchasing from my store.</p>

        <h3>27/04/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>I have learned how to use distinct and order by, limit and like functions by using the bookshop database.
            I am finding learning SQL easier than Python at the moment as I get much more completed. I have learned how
            to integrate all of these new functions to get the specific data asked for I have also had practice with
            searching for a lie function which has either a % or an _ which would usually produce an error..</p>

        <h3>28/04/2023 (Python)</h3>
        <p>Today I hve learned how to create a web server using flask and understand some basic code to run on the
            command line which will help me in the future, such as pip installing packages. I have also learned and put
            into practice nesting, passing functions and Python decorators which I found relatively simple and will be
            a nice addition to my Python knowledge.</p>

    <div id="eleven">
        <h3>02/05/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>I have learned some more functions today which consist of min and max, sub queries, group by and how to use
            them interchangeably. I found the sub queries the most difficult as it has to have two different selects which
            run separate but with some practice using the bookshop database, I am able to use it comfortably.</p>

        <h3>03/05/2023 (Python)</h3>
        <p>Today I have focused on learning the basics of running a website server using flask, following on from the
            28th. The course I was watching was outdated, so I went over to YouTube which helped me get started. With
            this I learned how to create views and routes along with rendering HTML, URL parameters and query parameters.
            I have found using flask difficult because of the outdated courses however, I will be focusing on this on the
            days I learn Python whilst continuing to work on SQL to refine my skills and put them to test.</p>

        <h3>04/05/2023 and 05/05/2023 (SQL)</h3>
        <p>Yesterday I focused on trying to analyse my vinted reviews using CSV and Pandas on Pycharm however, I was
            finding limited resources online on how to fix the errors in my code. I am still working on getting this
            fixed. In the meantime, today, I have imported the review data into MySQL and created a new table and
            database. From this I have been able to put to the test all of my new SQL skills I have been learning. I have
            managed to analyse and group how many reviews I get to see where my strengths are when posting items
            using this app. In previous days I had used web scraping to gather the data from Vinted which I used and
            formatted it to be able to be inserted into the SQl table. I have found how many automated reviews I have
            got and how many people have complimented the fast shipping. The images show which other groups I decided
            to do.</p>
        <img class="buyer" src="buyer.PNG"><p>40/212 reviews are me as the buyer so these do not matter.</p><img class="great" src="great.PNG"><p>55/212 said the word 'great' which indicates that they are happy with their purchase and with me as a seller as a whole.</p>
        <img class="postage" src="postage.PNG"><img class="quick" src="quick.PNG"><p>27/212 total specifically mentioned the postage, along with the speed in which the items were sent out.</p>
        <img class="love" src="love.PNG"><p>51/212 mentioned 'love' as either 'lovely seller' or 'love the item' which is one of my strongest attributes.</p>
        <img class="auto" src="auto.PNG"><p>40/212 reviews are automated which means I get a 5 star positive review if they don't leave one, meaning that this group is not the data I am looking for when it comes to finding out my strong points.</p>

        <h3>08/05/2023 (Python Pandas)</h3>
        <p>Today I have really tested my Pandas and Python knowledge within a large data set of online sales for a company.
        This includes items sold, price and id along with what month they were sold. I have followed a tutorial
        online which helped me through this process. I first concatenated all the month files into one large csv file
        so that I could analyse the data set as a whole. I then created a month column which would display the month,
        as a number, which will allow me to see them as a group later on. I then ran into a couple of problems which
        were solved by the use of static overflow. The problems were that some columns has a NaN (Not a Number)
        as a whole column which I was able to group together to remove. This wasn't allowing m,e to multiply the amount
        sold with the price at it was classed as a sting. I added another column called sales, after I dropped the NaN
        which was just the quantity purchased and the price. I then grouped the data (groupby) into months and made the
        data into a viewable bar chart using Matplotlib. This was my first time using this and I found it very easy and
        I love that you are able to visualise data this was which would make it much more simple when explaining results
        to someone else. The screenshots shown are from the video I was following as Jupyter was very bugged out as I
        tried to save, this should be fixed by tomorrow. I will only show a few screenshots as the whole code will be
        available on my GitHub page.</p>
